## Instructions to commit to the repository
- [ ] Create a new branch and add in your features in the form of commits.
- [ ] Upon doing so, please send a Pull Request to the master branch.

The master branch has protection access so, every PR needs to be reviewed by atleast one other person before merging.
This reduces issues in the project development cycle itself and should be a good start to working on the project without an issue.

### Anything else to note?
While it's great to have multiple branches, it's best to isolate commits and changes for a single feature to that branch itself.
So, if you're working on a login page, please make a separate branch called `login-page`, and send your commits into this branch.

If the development of that particular feature is done, then, please send a PR to the `test` branch.
We'll figure when the `test` branch is ready to be merged into the `main` branch, and we'll proceed ahead with it, once it is finalized that it is good to go.
